abstract = {This study examined how desktop virtual reality (VR) enhances learning and not merely does desktop VR influence learning. Various relevant constructs and their measurement factors were identified to examine how desktop VR enhances learning and the fit of the hypothesized model was analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results supported the indirect effect of VR features to the learning outcomes, which was mediated by the interaction experience and the learning experience. Learning experience which was individually measured by the psychological factors, that is, presence, motivation, cognitive benefits, control and active learning, and reflective thinking took central stage in affecting the learning outcomes in the desktop VR-based learning environment. The moderating effect of student characteristics such as spatial ability and learning style was also examined. The results show instructional designers and VR software developers how to improve the learning effectiveness and further strengthen their desktop VR-based learning implementation. Through this research, an initial theoretical model of the determinants of learning effectiveness in a desktop VR-based learning environment is contributed.},

abstract = {Technology-enhanced learning, employing novel forms of content representation and education service delivery by enhancing the visual perception of the real environment of the user, is favoured by proponents of educational inclusion for learners with physical disabilities. Such an augmented reality computer-mediated learning system has been developed as part of an EU funded research project, namely the CONNECT project. The CONNECT project brings together schools and science centres, and produces novel information and communication technologies based on augmented reality (AR) and web-based streaming and communication, in order to support learning in a variety of settings. The CONNECT AR interactive learning environment can assist users to better contextualize and reinforce their learning in school and in other settings where people learn (i.e. science centres and home). The CONNECT concept and associated technologies encourage users to visit science centres and perform experiments that are not possible in school. They can also build on these experiences back at school and at home with visual augmentations that they are communicated through web-based streaming technology. This paper particularly focuses on a user-centred evaluation approach of human factors and pedagogical aspects of the CONNECT system, as applied to a special needs user group. The main focus of the paper is on highlighting the human factors issues and challenges, in terms of wearability and technology acceptance, while elaborating on some qualitative aspects of the pedagogical effectiveness of the instructional medium that AR technology offers for this group of learners.},

Pre-service teachers at an Australian university took part in a hybrid tutorial lesson involving a mixture of students who were co-located in the same face-to-face (F2F) classroom along with others who were participating remotely via their avatars in a three-dimensional virtual world. Video and sound recording equipment captured activity in the classroom, which was streamed live into the virtual world so the remote participants could see and hear their instructor and F2F peers; the in-world activity was also simultaneously displayed on a projector screen, with the audio broadcast via speakers, for the benefit of the F2F participants. While technical issues constrained communication and learning in some instances, the majority of remote and F2F participants felt the blended reality environment supported effective communication, collaboration and co-presence. Qualitative analysis of participant evaluations revealed a number of pedagogical, technological and logistical factors that supported and constrained learning. The article concludes with a detailed discussion of present and future implications of blended reality collaborative environments for learning and teaching as well as recommendations for educators looking to design and deliver their own blended reality lessons.},

abstract = {Thanks to the increasing availability of consumer head-mounted displays, educational applications of immersive VR could now reach to the general public, especially if they include gaming elements (immersive serious games). Safety education of citizens could be a particularly promising domain for immersive serious games, because people tend not to pay attention to and benefit from current safety materials. In this paper, we propose an HMD-based immersive game for educating passengers about aviation safety that allows players to experience a serious aircraft emergency with the goal of surviving it. We compare the proposed approach to a traditional aviation safety education method (the safety card) used by airlines. Unlike most studies of VR for safety knowledge acquisition, we do not focus only on assessing learning immediately after the experience but we extend our attention to knowledge retention over a longer time span. This is a fundamental requirement, because people need to retain safety procedures in order to apply them when faced with danger. A knowledge test administered before, immediately after and one week after the experimental condition showed that the immersive serious game was superior to the safety card. Moreover, subjective as well as physiological measurements employed in the study showed that the immersive serious game was more engaging and fear-arousing than the safety card, a factor that can contribute to explain the obtained superior retention, as we discuss in the paper.},

abstract = { A framework that delineates the relationships between learner control and learning effectiveness is absent. This study aims to fill this void. Unlike previous research, this study compares the learning effectiveness between two learning environments: traditional classroom and Technology-mediated Virtual Learning Environment (TVLE). Our work focuses on the effectiveness of a TVLE in the context of basic information technology skills training.  Grounded in the technology-mediated learning literature, this study presents a framework that addresses the relationship between the learner control and learning effectiveness, which contains four categories: learning achievement, self-efficacy, satisfaction, and learning climate. In order to compare the learning effectiveness under traditional classroom and TVLE, we conducted a field experiment. Data were collected from a junior high school of Taiwan. A total of 210 usable responses were analyzed. We identified four results from this study. (1) Students in the TVLE environment achieve better learning performance than their counterparts in the traditional environment; (2) Students in the TVLE environment report higher levels of computer self-efficacy than their counterparts in the traditional environment; (3) Students in the TVLE environment report different levels of satisfaction than students in the traditional environment; and (4) Students in the TVLE environment report higher levels of learning climate than their counterparts in the traditional environment. The implications of this study are discussed, and further research directions are proposed.},

The more a virtual immersive experience is based on design strategies that combine actional, symbolic, and sensory factors, the greater the participant's suspension of disbelief that she or he is "inside" a digitally enhanced setting. Studies have shown that immersion in a digital environment can enhance education in at least three ways: by allowing multiple perspectives, situated learning, and transfer. Further studies are needed on the capabilities of immersive media for learning, on the instructional designs best suited to each type of immersive medium, and on the learning strengths and preferences these media develop in users.},

abstract = {Abstract The purpose of this study was to document how teachers and students describe and comprehend the ways in which participating in an augmented reality (AR) simulation aids or hinders teaching and learning. Like the multi-user virtual environment (MUVE) interface that underlies Internet games, AR is a good medium for immersive collaborative simulation, but has different strengths and limitations than MUVEs. Within a design-based research project, the researchers conducted multiple qualitative case studies across two middle schools (6th and 7th grade) and one high school (10th grade) in the northeastern United States to document the affordances and limitations of AR simulations from the student and teacher perspective. The researchers collected data through formal and informal interviews, direct observations, web site posts, and site documents. Teachers and students reported that the technology-mediated narrative and the interactive, situated, collaborative problem solving affordances of the AR simulation were highly engaging, especially among students who had previously presented behavioral and academic challenges for the teachers. However, while the AR simulation provided potentially transformative added value, it simultaneously presented unique technological, managerial, and cognitive challenges to teaching and learning.},

The enhanced model shares the common goal with Dalgarno and Lee of identifying the learning benefits from using 3-D VLEs. The approach adopted here is to attempt a more pedagogical description using the concept of pedagogical immersion as derived from Mayes and Fowler's framework for mapping stages of learning onto types of learning environment. The paper adopts a “design for learning” perspective and in doing so hopes the combined framework will prove useful to those designing learning activities in 3-D VLEs.},

abstract = {These 2 studies investigate the extent to which an Embodied Mixed Reality Learning Environment (EMRELE) can enhance science learning compared to regular classroom instruction. Mixed reality means that physical tangible and digital components were present. The content for the EMRELE required that students map abstract concepts and relations onto their gestures and movements so that the concepts would become grounded in embodied action. The studies compare an immersive, highly interactive learning platform that uses a motion-capture system to track students' gestures and locomotion as they kinesthetically learn with a quality classroom experience (teacher and content were held constant). Two science studies are presented: chemistry titration and disease transmission. In the counterbalanced design 1 group received the EMRELE intervention, while the other group received regular instruction; after 3 days and a midtest, the interventions switched. Each study lasted for 6 days total, with 3 test points: pretest, midtest, and posttest. Analyses revealed that placement in the embodied EMRELE condition consistently led to greater learning gains (effect sizes ranged from 0.53 to 1.93), compared to regular instruction (effect sizes ranged from 0.09 to 0.37). Order of intervention did not affect the final outcomes at posttest. These results are discussed in relation to a new taxonomy of embodiment in educational settings. We hypothesize that the positive results are due to the embodiment designed into the lessons and the high degree of collaboration engendered by the co-located EMRELE. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Psychological Association.},

abstract = {Practical training is what brings imagination and creativity to fruition, which relies significantly on the relevant technical skills needed. Thus, the current study has placed its emphasis on strengthening the learning of technical skills with emerging innovations in technology, while studying the effects of employing such technologies at the same time. As for the students who participated in the study, technical skills had been cultivated in the five dimensions of knowledge, comprehension, simulation, application, and creativity, in accordance to the set teaching objectives and the taxonomy for students learning outcome, while the virtual reality learning environment (VRLE) has also been developed to meet different goals as the various technical skills were being examined. In terms of the nature of technology, operation of machines, selection of process parameters, and process planning in technical skills, VRLE has also designed the six modules of "learning resource", "digital content", "collaborative learning", "formative evaluation", "simulation of manufacturing process", and "practical exercise" in particular for providing students with assistance in the development on their technical skills on a specific, gradual basis. After assessing the technical skills that have been developed for the time period of one semester, the students have reported finding VRLE to be a significantly effective method when considering the three dimensions of "operation of machines", "selection of process parameter", and "process planning", though not so much so when it came to the dimension of "nature of technology". Among the six modules, "simulation of manufacturing process" and "practical exercise" were the two that were most preferred by students for the three dimensions considered.},

The novel sets portrait analysing interconnections between students' learning styles, their preferred learning activities, relevant teaching/learning methods, and LOs types is presented in more detail. The well-known standardised vocabularies of teaching/learning methods and LOs types were used to establish these interconnections. The sets portrait of these interconnections is followed by the appropriate ontology. The ontology is considered as an appropriate tool to create learners' personalised learning environments consisting of LOs, suitable teaching/learning methods and activities according to their preferred learning styles. The ontology should help the learner to find suitable LOs according to preferred learning methods/activities, and vice versa, and thus to personalise learning.

abstract = {This study aims to verify the learning effectiveness of a desktop virtual reality (VR)-based learning environment, and to investigate the effects of desktop VR-based learning environment on learners with different spatial abilities. The learning outcome was measured cognitively through academic performance. A quasi pretest-posttest experimental design was employed for this study. A total of 431 high school students from four randomly selected schools participated in this study where they were randomly assigned to either experimental or control groups based on intact classes. Findings indicate a significant difference in the performance achievement between the two groups with students performed better using desktop virtual reality. A possible explanation is that the desktop virtual reality instructional intervention has helped to reduce extraneous cognitive load and engages learners in active processing of instructional material to increase germane cognitive load. A significant interaction effect was found between the learning mode and spatial ability with regard to the performance achievement. Further analysis shows a significant difference in the performance of low spatial ability learners in the experimental and control groups, but no statistically significant difference in the performance of high spatial learners in both groups. The results signify that low spatial ability learners' performance, compared with high spatial ability learners, appeared to be more positively affected by the desktop VR-based learning environment which is supported by the ability-as-compensator hypothesis, and can be explained by the cognitive load theory. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was designed to identify factors that can explain teachers use of e-learning environments in higher education. A questionnaire was completed by 178 teachers from a wide variety of departments at Wageningen University in the Netherlands. We found that 43{\%} of the total variance in teacher use of e-learning environments could be explained by their opinions about web-based activities and their opinions about computer-assisted learning (predictors) and the perceived added value of e-learning environments (mediating variable). In other words, teachers use of e-learning environments can be explained to a high extent by their perceptions of the added value of these environments, which in turn are substantially influenced by their opinions about web-based activities and computer-assisted learning.},

abstract = {Journey to the Centre of the Cell (JTCC) is a multi-disciplinary initiative exploring the visualisation of nanotechnology. This particular VR research work demonstrates how Virtual Reality (VR) on HTC Vive head mounted display (HMD) can be used as a platform to interact with cell structures in a compelling immersive experience. Contemporary scientific cellular imaging modalities such as Fluorescence Microscopy and Serial Block Face Scanning Electron Microscopy can capture detailed cross-sectional image slices of molecular structures. The subsequent post-processed 3D data visualisation can provide additional educational insight for lay users. For the artist-researcher, this potential to educate raises valuable questions for further investigation, such as what 3D visualisation narrative should we adopt? In research work being carried out at the 3D Visualisation Aesthetics Lab (VAL) at UNSW Australia, arts-led modes of data augmentation are being developed to widen access to lay users, such as undergraduate science students. The prototype VR experience allows users to see nanoparticle cellular interactions on the surface of the cell as they enter the internal structure. The immersive visual work is a hybrid of ISO surface data and 3D arts-based representation. The prototype illustrates three cellular processes for nanoparticle internalisation: caveolar, macropinocytic and clathrin-mediated. This work builds on previous visualisation work carried out in the 3D-VAL using clinical imaging data in VR [1][2] for patient communication. 1. Caveolae are 60-80 nm wide pits in the plasma membrane that play a role in endocytosis. 2. Macropinocytosis is an actin-dependent endocytic process that leads to non-selective internalisation of fluid and membrane into large vacuoles (known as macropinosomes). 3. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is initiated by the binding of a ligand to a membrane receptor.},

With a webcam and a laptop, augmented reality application development is highly accessible. The visualization application research detailed here will be used for formal pedagogical research examining whether students benefit from this method by conducting both pre-event and post-event assessment surveys.

A total of 13 studies (N = 3081) in the category of games, 29 studies (N = 2553) in the category of games, and 27 studies (N = 2798) in the category of virtual worlds were meta-analyzed. The key inclusion criteria were that the study came from K-12 or higher education settings, used experimental or quasi-experimental research designs, and used a learning outcome measure to evaluate the effects of the virtual reality-based instruction. Results suggest games (FEM = 0.77; REM = 0.51), simulations (FEM = 0.38; REM = 0.41), and virtual worlds (FEM = 0.36; REM = 0.41) were effective in improving learning outcome gains. The homogeneity analysis of the effect sizes was statistically significant, indicating that the studies were different from each other. Therefore, we conducted moderator analysis using 13 variables used to code the studies. Key findings included that: games show higher learning gains than simulations and virtual worlds. For simulation studies, elaborate explanation type feedback is more suitable for declarative tasks whereas knowledge of correct response is more appropriate for procedural tasks. Students performance is enhanced when they conduct the game play individually than in a group. In addition, we found an inverse relationship between number of treatment sessions learning gains for games. With regards to the virtual world, we found that if students were repeatedly measured it deteriorates their learning outcome gains. We discuss results to highlight the importance of considering instructional design principles when designing virtual reality-based instruction.},

The results supported all the hypothesized relationships except one. Usability strongly mediated the relationship between 3D virtual reality features, spatial orientation, self-efficacy.; presence. Spatial orientation and self-efficacy had statistically significant, positive impact on the chemistry learning test. The results indicate that 3D virtual reality-based instruction is effective for enhancing students' chemistry achievement.

However, some decision models have been proposed in order to be incorporated and support the collaborative training evaluation process of surgical teams in Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs). This paper aims to discuss some possibilities and advantages of using the CVEs for the training process and assessment of surgical teams as well as presenting the steps of planning and development of a new simulator with these features, called SimCEC. The discussion is held in a computational modelling and implementation optic.},

abstract = {A contentious issue has been in debate for the past decade, over the extent of dependency of current generations of students on information and communication technology (ICT) for education. Despite this controversy, there is a generalization amongst researchers that fundamental shifting of educational methods towards e-learning is deemed inevitable and beneficial to cater for emerging students' skills and preferences. One of these newly emergent e-learning platforms is 3D Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) like Second Life. To the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first to derive and critically analyse, using grounded theory, advantageous and disadvantageous themes and their sub concepts of providing e-learning through 3DVLEs.},

@article{Sitzmann2011,
abstract = {Interactive cognitive complexity theory suggests that simulation games are more effective than other instructional methods because they simultaneously engage trainees' affective and cognitive processes (Tennyson {\&} Jorczak, 2008). Meta-analytic techniques were used to examine the instructional effectiveness of computer-based simulation games relative to a comparison group (k = 65, N = 6,476). Consistent with theory, post-training self-efficacy was 20{\%} higher, declarative knowledge was 11{\%} higher, procedural knowledge was 14{\%} higher, and retention was 9{\%} higher for trainees taught with simulation games, relative to a comparison group. However, the results provide strong evidence of publication bias in simulation games research. Characteristics of simulation games and the instructional context also moderated the effectiveness of simulation games. Trainees learned more, relative to a comparison group, when simulation games conveyed course material actively rather than passively, trainees could access the simulation game as many times as desired, and the simulation game was a supplement to other instructional methods rather than stand-alone instruction. However, trainees learned less from simulation games than comparison instructional methods when the instruction the comparison group received as a substitute for the simulation game actively engaged them in the learning experience.},

abstract = {The contemporary economic and working environment is more complex and turbulent than ever before. On the one hand, enterprises must succeed in turbulent and fast changing global markets. On the other hand, traditional models of the regular employee have been substituted by dynamic biographies. Nowadays, individuals are required to refresh their knowledge and modify their skills constantly and for a long working life while organizations have to use efficient instruments for the flexible transfer of work-related knowledge. These enhanced requirements of individual qualification and competency development conflict with the increasing time pressure of the economic and everyday life. This paper firstly analyzes lifelong learning and continuous competency development as essential requirements in a modern working environment. The socioeconomic dilemma, Time for Learning Processes vs. Time Pressure, however, shows that in the tightened conditions of today's economy the fulfilment of these requirements can only be obtained by innovative forms of work-integrated learning. Based on these results the paper finally describes the concept of Microtraning as one example of an efficient method of work-integrated learning and powerful measures to face the dilemma described},

abstract = {The ARIES system for creating and presenting 3D image-based augmented reality learning environments is presented. To evaluate the attitude of learners toward learning in ARIES augmented reality environments, a questionnaire was designed based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) enhanced with perceived enjoyment and interface style constructs. For empirical study, a scenario of a chemistry experimental lesson was developed. The study involved students of the second grade of lower secondary school. As follows from this study, perceived usefulness and enjoyment had a comparable effect on the attitude toward using augmented reality environments. However, perceived enjoyment played a dominant role in determining the actual intention to use them. The interface style based on physical markers had significant impact on perceived ease of use. Interface style and perceived ease of use had a weak influence on perceived enjoyment. In contrast, these two constructs had a significantly stronger influence on perceived usefulness. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The research model is tested using a questionnaire survey of 212 participants. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed to test the reliability and validity of the measurements. The partial least squares (PLS) method was used to validate the measurement and hypotheses. The empirical findings indicate that computer self-efficacy, performance expectations, system functionality, content feature, interaction, and learning climate are the primary determinants of student learning satisfaction with BELS. The results also show that learning climate and performance expectations significantly affect learning satisfaction. Computer self-efficacy, system functionality, content feature and interaction significantly affect performance expectations. Interaction has a significant effect on learning climate. The findings provide insight into those factors that are likely significant antecedents for planning and implementing a blended e-learning system to enhance student learning satisfaction.},

abstract = {Teaching and learning are no longer restricted to traditional classrooms, while e-learning (electronic learning) has become one of the powerful supporting tools which have diversified the traditional context of learning in colleges. With the rapid development of technology, the Internet as a delivery platform has motivated colleges to invest their resources on developing online programs. Meanwhile, the blended course, which combines online components with the conventional face-to-face components, has emerged as alternative mode of teaching and learning and a substantial supplement. With opportunities and barriers as well, however, the development and management of e-learning are still challenging, especially for the continuous improvement of students' learning effectiveness via e-learning for blended courses. This paper applies the socio-technical systems theory to review and integrate theories on students' e-learning from a macro view. To make up the insufficiency of related research, literature review is conducted first, and an analysis model is constructed to thoroughly explore factors affecting e-learning effectiveness. Later, through a questionnaire survey on students' adoption of e-learning and subsequent multi-level data analysis, hypotheses on the relationship of the influencing factors and the research model are verified. Results show that e-learning effectiveness (usefulness of e-learning, use, and e-learning performance) is simultaneously or alternately affected by direct or moderating factors of the technical system and the social system at the learning environment level and the individual level. Compared with the existing research, this paper uses a more comprehensive system view to construct the theoretical model and empirically verify it. The results can be a reference for future researchers and managers of e-learning in colleges. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},
